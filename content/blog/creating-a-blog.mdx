description: A guide on the process for creating a blog using Next.js, Contentlayer and mdx
---

<Callout>
  Iâ€™m taking a very meta approach and making my first blog post about creating
  this very blog.
</Callout>

#### Minor backstory

> Iâ€™ve recently re-done my personal website as the previous version was built back in 2020, and as we know technology and preferences, especially around the JS ecosystem change very quickly so now felt like a great time to ditch the pages router and styled-components in favour of the app router and tailwind.

> In the past, Iâ€™ve done the odd medium post or document at work but have never really had a platform to just speak my mind or ever had the want to do so, but at SoPost Iâ€™ve been working much closer to the product side. Weâ€™ve been adopting some of the ideas and processes from the team at [37signals](https://37signals.com/) which has been inspiring and has lead to me reading [Getting Real](https://basecamp.com/gettingreal) and wanting to do some more side projects and document my learnings as I attempt things like infrastructure as code, product design and marketing from the perspective of a Software Engineer.

## Getting started

<Callout>
  This guide assumes that you have basic knowledge of working with git, the
  command line and Next.js, if you arenâ€™t too familiar with Next.js, Iâ€™d
  recommend going through [Next.js Learn](https://nextjs.org/learn).
</Callout>

If youâ€™re starting from scratch youâ€™ll want to create a new app with [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/create-next-app) making sure that you are using tailwind and typescript (accepting all the defaults is pretty safe), you can call this whatever you want i.e. `danbillson.com` or `blog`, etc. optionally, Iâ€™d also recommend getting set up with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next), now we can start setting up Contentlayer which will be a very similar guide to the one of [their site](https://contentlayer.dev/docs/getting-started-cddd76b7#install-dependencies).

### Install dependencies

Install contentlayer, the Next.js plugin, a set of date formatting utils, and [tailwind typography](https://contentlayer.dev/docs/getting-started-cddd76b7#install-dependencies).

```bash
npm install contentlayer next-contentlayer date-fns @tailwindcss/typography
```

### Hook up Contentlayer

This will allow us to have hot reloading when editing markdown files thanks to the `withContentLayer` higher-order function.

```jsx
// next.config.mjs
import { withContentlayer } from "next-contentlayer";

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
};

export default withContentlayer(nextConfig);
```

### Update tsconfig.json

```json
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    //  ^^^^^^^^^^^
    "paths": {
      "contentlayer/generated": ["./.contentlayer/generated"]
      // ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    }
  },
  "include": [
    "next-env.d.ts",
    "**/*.ts",
    "**/*.tsx",
    ".next/types/**/*.ts",
    ".contentlayer/generated"
    // ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  ]
}
```

### Ignore the built files

We need to make sure we arenâ€™t committing the cached build files to git.

```bash
# .gitignore

# ...

# contentlayer
.contentlayer
```

## Get ready for some content

This is where we venture a little further away from the Contentlayer guide and more towards [shadcn/taxonomy](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/taxonomy) as we are going to put our blog posts on the `/blog` path and allow nested directories to support categories, if you just want the whole site to be a blog on the root then you can follow along closer to the [Contentlayer guide](https://contentlayer.dev/docs/getting-started-cddd76b7#2-define-content-schema).

### Add Contentlayer config file

This is where weâ€™re going to define the schema for our blog posts.

```jsx
// contentlayer.config.js
import { defineDocumentType, makeSource } from "contentlayer/source-files";

/** @type {import('contentlayer/source-files').ComputedFields} */
const computedFields = {
  slug: {
    type: "string",
    resolve: (doc) => `/${doc._raw.flattenedPath}`,
  },
  slugAsParams: {
    type: "string",
    resolve: (doc) => doc._raw.flattenedPath.split("/").slice(1).join("/"),
  },
};

export const Post = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: "Post",
  filePathPattern: `blog/**/*.md`,
  fields: {
    title: { type: "string", required: true },
    description: { type: "string" },
    date: { type: "date", required: true },
    published: {
      type: "boolean",
      default: true,
    },
  },
  computedFields,
}));

export default makeSource({
  contentDirPath: "./content",
  documentTypes: [Post],
});
```

This expects us to put all of our markdown files in the `content/blog` directory.

### Create your first post

Create a new file at `content/blog/post-01.md` and start writing your first post, an example of this file could look like this:

```markdown
---
title: My First Post
description: This is my first blog post
date: 2024-06-15
---

Mum, get the camera ðŸ“·
```

## Add the blog routes

Spin up the development server with `npm run dev` (or your package manager equivalent) which should generate the blog posts which can be imported.

### Blog listings

Create a new file at `app/blog/page.tsx` which will be the page to list all of the blog posts, copy and edit the following as you see fit:

```jsx
// app/blog/page.tsx
import { formatDate } from "@/lib/utils";
import { allPosts } from "contentlayer/generated";
import { compareDesc } from "date-fns";
import type { Metadata } from "next";
import Link from "next/link";

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Blog"
};

export default function Blog() {
  const posts = allPosts.sort((a, b) =>
    compareDesc(new Date(a.date), new Date(b.date)),
  );

  return (
    <section>
      <h1 className="font-medium text-2xl mt-14 mb-8 tracking-tighter">blog</h1>

      {posts?.length ? (
        <div className="grid gap-10 sm:grid-cols-2">
          {posts.map((post, index) => (
            <article key={post._id} className="group relative flex flex-col">
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-medium">{post.title}</h2>
              {post.date && (
                <time
                  dateTime={post.date}
                  className="text-sm text-muted-foreground"
                >
                  {formatDate(post.date)}
                </time>
              )}
              {post.description && (
                <p className="text-muted-foreground mt-4">{post.description}</p>
              )}
              <Link href={post.slug} className="absolute inset-0">
                <span className="sr-only">View Article</span>
              </Link>
            </article>
          ))}
        </div>
      ) : (
        <p>No posts published.</p>
      )}
    </section>
  );
}
```

Now if you go to [`localhost:3000/blog`](http://localhost:3000/blog) you should be greeted with a nice, fresh blog listings page.

### Blog posts

If youâ€™ve tried clicking through to your post, you may have noticed that you get a 404, now weâ€™ll add the route to handle blog posts. Create a new file at `app/blog/[...slug]/page.tsx` and add the following:

```jsx
// app/blog/[...slug]/page.tsx
import { formatDate } from "@/lib/utils";
import { allPosts } from "contentlayer/generated";
import type { Metadata } from "next";
import { notFound } from "next/navigation";

type BlogPostProps = {
  params: { slug: string[] };
};

async function getPostFromParams(params: BlogPostProps["params"]) {
  const slug = params?.slug?.join("/");
  const post = allPosts.find((post) => post.slugAsParams === slug);

  if (!post) {
    null;
  }

  return post;
}

export async function generateMetadata({
  params,
}: BlogPostProps): Promise<Metadata> {
  const post = await getPostFromParams(params);

  if (!post) {
    return {};
  }

  return { title: post.title, description: post.description };
}

export const generateStaticParams = async () =>
  allPosts.map((post) => ({ slug: post.slugAsParams.split("/") }));

export default async function BlogPost({ params }: BlogPostProps) {
  const post = await getPostFromParams(params);

  if (!post) {
    notFound();
  }

  return (
    <article className="py-8">
      <div className="mb-8 text-center prose prose-neutral">
        <time dateTime={post.date} className="mb-1 text-xs text-gray-600">
          {formatDate(post.date)}
        </time>
        <h1 className="text-3xl font-medium">{post.title}</h1>
      </div>
      <div
        className="[&>*]:mb-3 [&>*:last-child]:mb-0"
        dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: post.body.html }}
      />
    </article>
  );
}

```

<Callout>
  If things arenâ€™t quite working as expected, you can check out this [pull
  request](https://github.com/danbillson/danbillson.com/pull/1) to see all of
  the changes that were added whilst I was setting up this blog.
</Callout>

This should now be enough to get you up and running with a simple blog using markdown, you can now continue creating files in the `content/blog` directory or we can keep going and add support for [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

## Bonus round: MDX

If youâ€™re considering starting a blog that involves some sort of coding discipline then you may want to continue as weâ€™re going to look at how to get these super nice code snippets and be able to render custom React components in markdown.

<Callout>
  This section is a little more involved in the last section so here is a link
  to the [pull request](https://github.com/danbillson/danbillson.com/pull/2)
  that added support for MDX as youâ€™ll probably want to copy and paste
  `components/mdx-components.tsx` , `content/blog/engineering/test-03.mdx` ,
  `styles/mdx.css` and maybe a couple of others if you want.
</Callout>

### Install more dependencies

We're going to grab a few packages from the team atÂ [@unifiedjs](https://github.com/unifiedjs)Â such asÂ [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark)Â for MDX parsing andÂ [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype)Â for code highlighting.

```jsx
npm install -D rehype rehype-autolink-headings rehype-pretty-code rehype-slug remark remark-gfm@3.0.1
```

### Update Contentlayer config

This just shows some of the additions, not the whole file

```jsx
// contentlayer.config.js

// add new imports
import rehypeAutolinkHeadings from "rehype-autolink-headings";
import rehypePrettyCode from "rehype-pretty-code";
import rehypeSlug from "rehype-slug";
import remarkGfm from "remark-gfm";

// update our posts to use mdx
export const Post = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: "Post",
  filePathPattern: `blog/**/*.mdx`,
  contentType: "mdx",
  ...
}));

// add remark and rehype plugins
export default makeSource({
  contentDirPath: "./content",
  documentTypes: [Post],
  mdx: {
    remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
    rehypePlugins: [
      rehypeSlug,
      [
        rehypePrettyCode,
        {
          theme: "snazzy-light",
          onVisitLine(node) {
            if (node.children.length === 0) {
              node.children = [{ type: "text", value: " " }];
            }
          },
        },
      ],
      [
        rehypeAutolinkHeadings,
        {
          properties: {
            className: ["subheading-anchor"],
            ariaLabel: "Link to section",
          },
        },
      ],
    ],
  },
});
```

### Add MDX components

Copy any new files from this [pull request](https://github.com/danbillson/danbillson.com/pull/2/files#diff-18f8a46c0c7267228f09602da973c922e45bd61a872bb9dbfa8edf5145d4a292)

- `components/mdx-components.tsx`
- `components/mdx-card.tsx`
- `components/callout.tsx`
- `styles/mdx.css`

### Update the blog post page

Import and use the new `Mdx` component

```jsx {2,3,9}
// app/blog/[...slug]/page.tsx
+      import { Mdx } from "@/components/mdx-components";
+.     import "@/styles/mdx.css";

-      <div
-       className="[&>*]:mb-3 [&>*:last-child]:mb-0"
-        dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: post.body.html }}
-      />
+      <Mdx code={post.body.code} />
```

With this, you should be able to test the [example .mdx](https://github.com/danbillson/danbillson.com/pull/2/files#diff-f054cb896a220d4d935d783c788b4c366eec9cf000c2d4a347bcb5a485f117a4) file to make sure everything is working properly, if not, double-check the changes made in the [pull request](https://github.com/danbillson/danbillson.com/pull/2) to see if anything has been missed.

## Next steps

Now itâ€™s time to write your own blog post, since this is my first post I wonâ€™t be able to give too much advice on how to write a blog post any time soon but I can recommend going and watching [Ali Abdaalâ€™s video](https://youtu.be/vyVpRiqOvt4?feature=shared) on how he went about starting a blog and the lessons he has learned from doing so.
