This is a completely subjective list of my favourite places to drink around London from someone that is primarily a craft beer drinker but appreciates all kinds of drinks after spending 6 months living in East London.

## 1. Macintosh Ales

A tiny little micro brewery running out of a converted barn in Stoke Newington which serves just two beers, a pale ale and a bitter which are both top class. A real hidden gem.

## 2. Kanpai

The UK’s first sake brewery and the best sake you’ll find outside of Japan, ran by the most passionate and knowledgable people in the business, if you have any questions it isn’t uncommon for them to get a white marker out and start drawing diagrams on the table.

## 3. Seed Library

<InfoLinks
  location="Shoreditch"
  url="https://www.seedlibraryshoreditch.com/"
  instagram="https://www.instagram.com/seedlibraryshoreditch/?hl=en"
/>

A cosy speakeasy bar tucked away on Shoreditch High Street where you’ll likely find Dan Garnell, one of the most talented and friendly bartenders behind the bar. Here you’ll find some of the most unique and delicious cocktails in London.

## 4. Mother Kelly’s

<InfoLinks
  location="Bethnal Green"

/>

There are a few Mother Kelly’s bars dotted around London but the one in Bethnal Green is a local for me and sits right next to the tube station. Contains more than 20 rotating taps of great craft beers and a huge selection in the fridge which can always satisfy a craving if your looking for a mixed ferm sour or imperial stout.

## 5. The Kernel

<InfoLinks
  location="Bermondsey"

  instagram="https://www.instagram.com/thekernelbrewery/?hl=en"
/>

Another staple when visiting Bermondsey, The Kernel is home to some of the most well made simple beers such as the table beer or the export stouts and porters.

## 6. The Auld Shillelagh

Just across the road from Macintosh Ales you’ll find The Auld Shillelagh, an authentic Irish pub where you’ll find the best Guinness in London. (I don’t care what anyone else says)

## 7. Sager + Wilde

<InfoLinks
  location="Haggerston"
  url="https://www.sagerandwilde.com/"
  instagram="https://www.instagram.com/sagerandwilde/"
/>

Cosy wine bar on Hackney Road with a huge wine menu and really knowledgable staff to guide you through that menu where unless you’re a connoisseur you may easily get lost. Right next to Equal Parts and The Marksman which are both worth visiting as well.

## 8. Howling Hops

<InfoLinks
  location="Hackney Wick"
  url="https://www.howlinghops.co.uk/"
  instagram="https://www.instagram.com/howlinghopstankbar/"
/>

Maybe a little bit of a gimmick but very cool nonetheless, Howling Hops is a tank bar where there is served directly from the tank, as fresh as can be.

## 9. Spiritland

<InfoLinks
  location="Kings Cross"
  url="https://spiritland.com/"
  instagram="https://www.instagram.com/spiritland/?hl=en"
/>

A cosy music bar/cafe with events on most nights with a large audiophile quality sound system, perfect for music lovers.

## 10. Mikkeller

<InfoLinks
  location="Shoreditch"

  instagram="https://www.instagram.com/mikkellerbarlondon/?hl=en"
/>

The creative Danish brewery has opened a brewpub in Shoreditch with 20 taps and experimental beers that are brewed on site. A venture with Rick Astley of all people.

~ parting note

London has some of the most unique and exciting drinking holes that you can find but as far as pubs go, I think the Toon is still the best there is. Nothing beats the view over the Tyne from the Free Trade Inn on a sunny day or seeing the smiley faces of Alex and Alice in Axis.
